Mini Project 2

True Cart 

The objective of the project:

  Although, there are many existing web applications are available but we are trying to reach the
customers who are not able to buy the things online because of the unavailability of the product
when they want, there is a high possibility that the product is not deliverable in their area or they
lost their trust in online purchasing because of some providers who only rob them. And we can
also use this project to run the local businesses online that will help in the growth and
development of the person as well as for the country also. We are providing original and genuine
products to the users with the best price.
